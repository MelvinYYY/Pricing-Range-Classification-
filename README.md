# Pricing-Range-Classification-
Introduction

For any cell phone manufacturer, initiating a pricing strategy plays a crucial role because the market is price sensitive. While overpricing discourages the market demand, underpricing limits the potential revenue growth and undermines the brand image. Thus, striking the right balance between profit and the attractive/competitive price at the starting point becomes very critical while launching a new product. While a cell phone can have a variety of components that can together drive its price, typically a few factors can influence much more than others. In this research, we will study 14 such features, included Processor, RAM, Camera, etc., to analyze how varying those can impact the product price. The purpose of this case study is to empower the cell phone manufacturers in deciding the price range for their products.

For the purpose of this study, we have segregated the phones into 4 market segments based on the price. There are several qualitative prediction approaches that can be used to determine the price range, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Classification Tree. Our study will use these four methods to create different pricing models and choose the one that can help cell phone manufacturers make the best decision on their pricing strategy.
